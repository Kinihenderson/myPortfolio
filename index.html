        <h3>About Kini</h3> <!-- center this-->
        <p> Born and raised in Hawaii on the island of Oahu, I played piano for 10 years and have always enjoyed the concept of art (paintings, music, dance, etc.). 
            My passion for technology drew me to always wonder if Web Development would be a good fit for me as well due to my background being 
           in sales and management.   With that I took the leap on join Thinkful's Software Engineering program and I have found that my passion for technology not 
            only has grown but I have gotten a better understanding of how our web works. <p><i>" Software is a great combination of artistry and engineering." - Bill Gates</i></p>
